# High School Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my work and skills as a student. The portfolio includes sections about me, my projects, and ways to contact me. It aims to provide visitors with a comprehensive overview of my background and the work I've done.

## Project Overview

The portfolio features the following key components:

### About Me

### My Work
- A showcase of various projects I've completed. Each project includes:
  - A title and a clickable link to view or access the project.
  - A brief description of the project.
  - A GitHub icon linking to the project's repository for those interested in the code or further details.

### Contact Me
- A section that provides my contact information, including my phone number and email address, inviting potential collaborators or employers to reach out.

## Technologies Used
